Free and open source app for Huawei Freebuds 4i headphones 🎧

## Why 🧐

I wanted to quickly switch ANC modes on my headphones...

but official app is... well, bloated as hell 😑 - it weights 100mb, and takes (on my phone) 10 seconds to open...

Also, it doesn't have features like "find lost headphones", etc...

So I got mad and decided to make my own... and here it is 🌈

## Features 🔨

- [x] Switch ANC modes
- [x] Show battery levels
- [x] Sleep mode - disables gestures/anc/smart wear for nice sleeping
- [x] Change settings (smart wear etc) - partial (only smart wear) (more soon 🙏)
- [ ] Find lost
