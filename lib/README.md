# Hi!!!!!! 👋👋👋👋👋
You're coding and want to help out/explore around here? That's great!!!

Okay, so - UI code is as pure-flutter-future-stream as possible, and most stuff has comments/documentation, so just look around and read those 👍

Interesting rev-eng stuff is in `headphones/` folder, and there is dedicated [headphones/README.md](headphones/README.md) - head there 🫡

# Development notes - philosophies, TODOs etc

## Migration to framework-ish organisation
TODO:
- [X] Implement basic stuff (ANC + battery)
- [X] Change ui to work at all with new stuff
- [ ] Implement hp settings
  This is non trivial cause we have to decide how to make this universal when almost all headphones have this different
- [X] Change ui BIG to dynamically support *all* headphones by their features instead of concrete model -> pretty much done?
- [ ] Support multiple diff headphones
  - [ ] Basic fix in connection loops to show them at all
  - [ ] Basic fix in widget to maybe show their name to distinguish which ones are shown now
        Currently, widget just creates the cubit, wait until it connects, and gets the battery. What if there are
        multiple headphones? Right now it just... gets the first one 🤷
  - [ ] Some database stuf... ehhhh... to distinguish between them, remember their last time etc
    This is potentially waaayyy ahead todo as it requires *serious* decisions that will affect *everything* wayyy ahead in later development, so better not fuck it up
    - [ ] Selecting headphones when making new widget

## Future features:
- [ ] Detect hp colors and assign proper image
- [ ] ANC control widget
  This will require whole big background stuff, so that's far offs
