# 🔧 Getting started

> If you want to help developing freebuddy, most important thing you HAVE to know is that **you're very welcome in here 🤗**
> 
> I wish that one day, freebuddy could be a single app for *all* headphones, and I just couldn't even **buy** all of them myself 💸
> 
> Thus, whole documentation in this repo is made for you 🫵 - if you carefully read it, everything should be clear - if something isn't, let me know 🙌

# 🎧 Adding new headphones

# 🤖 Reverse engineering

# 📱 UI

This document should be:
 1. A declaration of how contributing on freebuddy looks like - where to look for help, what to read etc
2. A lighthouse/map to all other .md files about specific fields, that is:
   - freebudy architecture/workings - in lib/README.md
     - adding new headphones - in lib/headphones/README.md
     - hp's with new features - still in lib/hp/README.md, but with some conotations to global readme.. ? idk
     - adding new features - widgets etc - in lib/README.md
   - reverse engineering - in... idk where
     - lastgimbus.com couuuld provide some useful javascript applets, tho it may make more sense to just link to existing ones
